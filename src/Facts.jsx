                    “TEXAS HOLD ‘EM” is one of Beyonce’s surprise single from a her upcoming country-themed album, Renaissance act II. It was teased during her Super Bowl LVIII commercial and shortly released after.
                    The country song has heavy western and southern influences and can be seen as a love letter to the south and Beyoncé’s southern roots. The song features a banjo and viola played by Rhiannon Giddens.

                    Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, born September 4, 1981, better known professionally by her first name Beyoncé, is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, producer, actress and businesswoman.
                    In the twenty-first century, no pop star was as poised, as polished, or as generally fierce as Beyoncé. She scored early success with Destinys Child, who started out as a sexier and sassier version of TLC, then steadily became more and more of a vehicle for Beyoncés operatic vocals and general diva-tude, which may have been the plan all along.
